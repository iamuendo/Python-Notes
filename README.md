## What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

It is often used to build websites and programs, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.

<h3 id="why-python">Why you should learn Python?</h3>

- Python is free and open source hence anyone can contribute since it has a large community of developers & a vast number of libraries.
- Python supports a variety of programming paradigms.
- Python has become an industry standard.
- Python has a syntax that is easy to grasp.

<h3 id="characteristics">Characteristics of Python</h3>

#### 1. It is a dynamically typed language
In python, the variable type / data type is expressed at run time hence you don't have to specify the type of variable.

#### 2. It is portable
Python code can be easily transferred or used across multiple platforms i.e Windows, Linux, and Mac

#### 3. It is a high level language
When you code with python you don't have to be aware of the architecture as well as memory management.

#### 4. Can be intergrated with other languages
Like C and C++

#### 5. It is easy to debug
Provides specific information for tracing errors in a program.
